## How it works?
I used remix.ethereum.org to test & publish my code. So you can go to remix.ethereum.org and paste code to A file, and then compile + deploy it.

## Why I built this?
The refugees are not able to withdraw money in war from banks. So I wanted a decentralized way to withdraw money. Also you can donate to refuuges and view their needed eth amount and reasons for this money.
